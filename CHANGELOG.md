## [Unreleased]

- Restore the hosted Ethereum Classic baseline through the public Codex-backed identity snapshot, independent of Explore visibility filters and the retired Envio route. Preserve source freshness, release bindings and canonical block verification.

- Preserve the strict Robinhood V4 source-verification projection separately from canonical-Router provenance and Ethereum finality, and reserve `exact_match` for durable Sourcify V2 exact evidence.
- Activate Classic V4 discovery alongside historical V3 through manifest refresh, keep Classic V1 and V2 out of active scans, and exclude Stock-Paired records from active v2 discovery while preserving the immutable v1 compatibility snapshot.
- Replace the retired HTTP 410 Classic source with the complete paginated `https://programmable.market/api/explore` catalog bound to Envio deployment `production-6157d22`, and publish separate exact Classic V4 Router canary evidence with `classicOnchainCanary: true`. Router remains provenance and transport rather than a public category.
- Make the native Custom fee manifest explicitly conditional on exact per-launch fee evidence, and restore finalized Router metadata ingestion under the required quality envelope. SHARD's separately labeled platform-curated legacy image and links remain bound to its exact Router identity rather than altering signed project metadata.
- Reconcile the public Custom Launch contract: retain V1 and V2 historical reads while making authenticated POST nonretryable HTTP 409, accept fresh submissions only through V3 profile `3.3.0`, bind authorization to the exact static baseline and pinned Router simulation, keep missing or unavailable runtime behavior claims unverified, block authenticated executed negatives, and cap applicant-selected V3 fee rates at `100000` hundredths of a bip per direction and accounting mode while keeping the exact Programmable share at `1000`.
- Publish wallet-compatible V3 bearer authentication and the exact bounded partner-root/subkey contract through manifest, discovery, status, OpenAPI, human docs, and LLM surfaces, including controller selection, root aggregation, subkey lineage/rotation, equal metadata policy, and admin provisioning boundaries, without granting signing, broadcast, attribution-selection, security-bypass, approval-bypass, or client self-authorization authority.
- Add the immutable authenticated-partner attribution schema and optional v2 `launchedVia` projection, document complete current-profile metadata and finalized metadata ingestion, and keep external indexing and `safe` labels explicitly outside the guarantee.
- Publish the immutable checksum-bound CLI `3.3.8` locator and bind it to tarball SHA-256 `13b7a73ab87fa2acca8d3be672e32b89c2d895fe7a715c09f3b3617379f77a30`, byte length `308587`, and Custom Launch V3 OpenAPI `3.3.8` SHA-256 `e8c642e3318aa315ddbad42904befb0703865eff83176dcc0a0bb29c2b6d300d`; retain older CLI entries below as release history.
- Describe additive profile `3.4.0` only as pending fail-closed release readiness: it cannot be selected until the same-app runner and observation ABI are deployed and read back, a separately signed exact settlement-dataflow closure validates against its pinned authority trust root, and the CLI auto-injects and validates the canonical fee vault. Runner and closure assertions remain server-owned. Existing `3.3.0` reads and exact retries keep their original semantics.
- Correct the finalized Custom metadata source boundary to `finalized-v3-project-metadata-ledger`, retain metadata-bearing `3.2.0` and `3.3.0` rows while excluding pending and metadata-absent historical resources, and publish the required `launches` plus `quality` response envelope.
- Bind required profile `3.2.0` project name, symbol, presentation, image digest, and sorted links through `projectMetadataHash`, metadata-bound `graphBundleHash`, prepared resources, launch IDs, and wallet review while retaining metadata-absent `3.1.0`, `3.0.0`, and `2.0.0` resources and keeping finalized token readback and untrusted presentation data as separate evidence boundaries.
- Publish profile `3.2.0` with seven objective hard blocks, exact `3.1.0` and `3.0.0` read/retry compatibility, evidence-only treatment for complex governance/accounting/liquidity surfaces, platform-authored behavior evidence, six independent product truth axes, and bounded authenticated lifecycle-queue polling metadata without changing Developer feed records.
- Publish public V3 capability discovery and authenticated quota-free preflight discovery, including the standalone `programmable.custom-launch-preflight.v1` response schema, typed remediation, explicit no-persistence/no-wallet side effects, and separate deployable, routable, featured, deployment, trading, fee, verification, and indexing boundaries.
- Publish additive Direct Native Hook Graph Profile Revision 3 discovery for the live Custom Launch API V3 general lane: exact source/compiler/graph binding, blocking-versus-warning static indicators, mandatory exact Router simulation before authorization, live checksum-bound CLI `3.3.3` release discovery with bound project metadata and pre-wallet EIP-3009 nonce-cycle diagnostics, retained Revision 2 compatibility, and explicit non-audit, non-honeypot, non-liquidity, non-tradeability, and non-fee-behavior guarantees.
- Publish a separately identified Direct Native Hook Graph Profile Discovery V1 schema, manifest/status descriptor and integration guide as a fail-closed Custom Launch API V3 preview for profile version `1.0.0`: 3–16 direct targets over the Router's 2–16 and GraphFactory's 1–16 limits, distinct token/hook/initializer roles over `token|hook|other` component kinds, static LP fees no higher than `999999`, constrained v4 permission sets, ERC-20/native currencies, the two-stage `fundingIntentHash` flow, the full V3 selection binding and an inclusive selected-total 10-bps platform split; V1/V2 and the two public categories remain compatible while V3 API, CLI, permit-authority profile admission and feed support stay gated pending integration-owner activation.
- Clarify the additive v2 Custom source-provenance contract: accepted manifest-bound Registry evidence and consistent finalized canonical-Router `CustomGraph` evidence share the unchanged `custom` category while retaining distinct classification bases; API v1 is unchanged.
- Project finalized canonical-Router Custom token identities through the v2 launch feed and token list, with a bounded last-known-good snapshot and unavailable rather than invented market, supply, and fee data.
- Keep v2 launch-list and token-list readable across canonical-source outages and incomplete-coverage states, with explicit degraded or unavailable quality and preserved recognized identities.
- Publish the live Custom Launch API readiness link and mark legacy Registry and GitHub submission intake closed across discovery, manifest, OpenAPI, support, and agent documentation.
- Add support-safe problem timestamps and expose `Retry-After` alongside request IDs without including credentials.
- Publish stable prelaunch Generation 2 event-set and release-candidate metadata URLs without adding them to the live manifest.
- Add the optional provider-attribution schema and fail-closed trust semantics.
- Add a bounded full-traversal JavaScript reference and define Developer-manifest precedence over the Website operational mirror.
- Add direct onchain verification, Programmable Verified, multi-chain, and production integration guides.
- Document the additive Registry-backed v2 project, multi-asset, approval, deployment, review, fee, finality, authority, lifecycle, and presentation fields plus launch-ID detail lookup.
- Define Native Custom and partnership-template fee semantics, including the exact 20 bps total and 15/5 partner/Programmable split without an additional Native Custom fee.
- Document the current Basebit and Aion evidence blockers without presenting either integration as live.
- Add project-only-safe JavaScript examples and a typed v2 client covering discovery, feed, launch-ID, token, and token-list access.
- Add conditional Preview and Live release-post drafts.
- Correct the security support table to include canonical API v2 while retaining v1 compatibility support.
- Document the live operator claim console and its separate read-only discovery policy, wallet boundary, atomic batching, reviewed source inventory, and fail-closed Custom admission rules.
