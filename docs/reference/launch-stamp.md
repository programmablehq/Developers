# Launch stamp Router verification

`ProgrammableLaunchStampRouterV1` is an onchain provenance interface for Router-stamped Programmable launches. A valid lookup establishes that the exact canonical Router atomically executed and stamped the recorded launch. It also establishes that the recorded v4 pool was uninitialized before route execution and initialized before the stamp was written.

It does not universally prove that each Classic component was newly created. It does not establish current pool state or current liquidity, and it does not state that a contract is audited, safe, sellable, tradable, supported by a terminal, or suitable for a transaction.

## Deployment state

The frozen Router V1 interface and separate Ethereum and Robinhood deployment roots are published. Read the exact Router address and block range from the manifest. Its `deploymentEvidence` object pins the transaction, block hashes, runtime identities, immutable getter observations, and evidence hashes. Its `verificationStatus: finalized-verified` describes those deployment, runtime, and getter observations; it is not an Explorer source-publication status.

Router V1 is live on Ethereum for stamps written at or after block `25717612`.
The Ethereum manifest requires `64` confirmations for an explicit
block-number read. Historical launches are not backfilled.

Robinhood chain `4663` publishes a separate live Router through
`GET /api/v2/manifests/4663`. Require `directChainIntegration.status: "live"`,
then resolve its Router address, start block, runtime hash, ABI hash and
`evidenceUrl` dynamically. The published evidence binds its finalized
deployment and an existing finalized `CustomGraph` launch. Follow
`directChainIntegration.finality`: its `rpc-finalized` policy requires the
canonical finalized boundary and an explicit block must be its finalized
ancestor. Do not copy the Ethereum address, confirmation count or canary into
Robinhood verification. See the
[Robinhood terminal integration](https://developers.programmable.family/robinhood-terminal-indexer).
The Developer v2 normalized Robinhood hosted read model has separate availability. A direct-chain stamp lookup does not depend on it or on launch API admission. Use [product discovery](https://programmable.market/.well-known/programmable.json) for current V4 and MultiRole launch clients.

The [Robinhood release verifier](../../examples/verify-robinhood-release.mjs)
runs with Node.js 20 or later from a repository clone, without a package
install. Set `PROGRAMMABLE_RPC_URL` to the Robinhood HTTPS RPC and run
`node examples/verify-robinhood-release.mjs`. It derives the existing token
from the manifest canary receipt, then uses the chain-qualified generic stamp
verifier. Use an RPC that serves canonical finalized and historical hash-bound
reads; `latest` is never a substitute for finality.

The getter bundle records `CHAIN_ID = 1`, permit authority `0x755509eA6e3F5Ec1aA2E797bb68f1B87DD8b886b`, Graph Factory `0xB012e4A8F2c5FC4E8E4faCA9D5Ad6FfF13FBA887`, and PoolManager `0x000000000004444c5dc75cB358380D2e3dE08A90`, together with their runtime-code hashes. The active manifest bindings match these observations exactly.

### Finalized PCAN test vector

Activation is bound to the finalized deployment evidence above and two approved finalized Router canaries. This section begins with the finalized PCAN `CustomGraph` vector. `PCAN` is its human-readable token symbol, not an additional launch or trust identifier. The machine-readable vector is `launchStampRouter.canaryEvidence` in `GET https://developers.programmable.family/api/v2/manifest` (JSON Pointer `/launchStampRouter/canaryEvidence`). Its aggregate route coverage also points to the separate Classic V4 evidence described below.

Each published component proof returns the same launch ID and stamp hash:

| `stampProofs[].component` | `stampProofs[].launchId` | `stampProofs[].stampHash` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x87B108848B444bC44A01734D62C7be4a2fA64983` | `0x5a52180427785716bff0a36218dde89f0459db265d0c2bdfcfde81a8fe733c92` | `0x06cb71b38d9b8b1dd1ffcdb00f31c774be36f5473979c3831d5fd0c96cdaa579` |

The canary source commit is separate from the deployed Router artifact source commit `0a7134bbb912222639627fb9078df2f8dd3a6c38`; it does not replace the Router artifact binding. The two evidence SHA-256 values are supplied handoff digests, not files downloaded and recomputed in this repository.

The liquidity, LP position, fee, and supply fields are observations at canary block `25717953`. They do not establish current liquidity, safety, audit status, sellability, tradability, route support, or third-party integration.

### Finalized Classic V4 test vector

The separate machine-readable vector is `launchStampRouter.classicCanaryEvidence` (JSON Pointer `/launchStampRouter/classicCanaryEvidence`). It binds the current Classic V4 release to one finalized `LaunchKindV1.Classic` stamp, including the exact source release, launcher deployment/runtime, transaction and canonical block, launch and stamp commitments, component/runtime proofs, pool and position state, token supply, platform fee observation, and evidence digests. `classicCanaryEvidence.source.manifestPublication` separately binds the canonical published release manifest; its exact commit, tree, file location, and file digest remain manifest-only values rather than copied documentation constants.

Consumers must refresh the manifest, resolve the single enabled current Classic V4 deployment dynamically, and cross-check `classicCanaryEvidence` against that release and the same canonical Router. Never copy its address, start block, or evidence values into client code. This establishes `classicOnchainCanary: true` for the current route. It does not retroactively stamp Classic V3, reactivate Classic V1/V2, include Stock, or replace verification of another Classic launch.

### Guarantee and product boundary

Only a launch with a consistent record written by the exact canonical Router on the manifest-selected chain at or after its `startBlock` is Programmable through Router V1. The record proves that the Router atomically executed and stamped that launch, with the recorded pool uninitialized before route execution and initialized before the stamp. It does not universally prove that every Classic component was newly created. The same ABI, bytecode, event topics, metadata, logo, signer, or factory result from any other emitter does not qualify. Direct Classic launcher, Graph Factory, and Single Factory calls outside the Router do not qualify.

Publication makes this verification contract available to terminals; it does not mean GMGN, Axiom, FOMO, or another named terminal has integrated it automatically. Custom Launch API V1 and V2 retain historical reads, but their authenticated POST routes return nonretryable `409 CUSTOM_LAUNCH_V1_READ_ONLY` or `409 CUSTOM_LAUNCH_V2_READ_ONLY`; only V3 profile `3.3.0` accepts fresh submissions, and the closed GitHub approval flow must not be revived. These docs define read-only detection and verification; an API key is never wallet signing or broadcast authority.

Generic discovery of the PCAN token or v4 pool through GMGN's `uniswap_v4` and `poolId` fields is ordinary token and pool discovery. It is not verification of the canonical Router stamp and does not show that GMGN integrated the Programmable label. Treat third-party market metrics as third-party observations, not canonical onchain evidence. Verify provenance through the Router and read current pool state separately through PoolManager or StateView.

## Scope

Router V1 covers only launches executed through the live Router at or after its published start block:

- Programmable Classic launches with a valid Router stamp;
- Programmable Custom launches with a valid Router stamp; and
- one v4 market identified by `PoolManager + PoolId` per stamped launch.

Historical Classic or Custom coins are not backfilled. Single Factory launches and direct Classic launcher or Graph Factory calls do not create Router provenance.

Both labels derive from the same canonical Router record:

| Solidity value | Integer | Consumer class |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `LaunchKindV1.Invalid` | `0` | Reject |
| `LaunchKindV1.CustomGraph` | `1` | `Programmable Custom` |
| `LaunchKindV1.Classic` | `2` | `Programmable Classic` |

Universal discovery uses `launchIdByToken` or `launchIdByPool`, followed by `launchStamp`. The Classic hook is shared infrastructure and must never identify or classify a Classic launch. A Custom launch-owned hook can be an exclusive component, but token or pool lookup is the interoperable path.

## Trust root

Start at the official discovery document:

```text
https://developers.programmable.family/.well-known/programmable.json
-> manifestUrl
-> launchStampRouter
```

The Router trust tuple is:

```text
manifest chainId + launchStampRouter.address + launchStampRouter.startBlock
```

The manifest additionally pins the Router runtime-code hash, ABI URL, and published ABI-file SHA-256. Validate them before any lookup. Do not derive the Router address from a topic, factory address, token metadata, API response, transaction calldata, or copied deployment.

After a nonzero lookup, provenance identity is `chainId + Router address + launchId`. The Custom Registry, hosted launch feed, an indexer, Supabase, a server, and the permit service are not detection dependencies.

## Frozen interface

Normative ABI: [`abis/ethereum/programmable-launch-stamp-router-v1.json`](../../abis/ethereum/programmable-launch-stamp-router-v1.json)

The ABI hash is over the exact published file bytes, not normalized JSON. The Forge artifact path is an extraction reference. Its generated container is not tracked and its raw hash is intentionally not a trust field; parity is the exact `.abi` plus every `methodIdentifiers` entry at the pinned source commit and tree.

### Read selectors

| Manifest key | Signature | Selector | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chainId` | `CHAIN_ID()` | `0x85e1f4d0` | chain ID |

| `stampProof` | `stampProof(address)` | `0x174b9f9d` | launch ID, stamp hash |

There is no `launchIdByHook` getter. `launchIdByComponent` resolves only components recorded with exclusive scope; shared infrastructure is not a launch identity.

### Events

| Event signature | Indexed inputs | `topic0` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ProgrammableLaunchStampedV1(bytes32,address,address,address,bytes32,bytes32)` | `launchId`, `token`, `hook` | `0x6cf479a102f1eebc9244f48f8d68f6aa52b4c5a4516318df58ba46614a5b14f2` |
| `ProgrammableLaunchRouteStampedV1(bytes32,uint8,bytes32,bytes32,bytes32)` | `launchId`, `kind`, `routePayloadHash` | `0x45e7cc355b63ca67d6278a0d8d23470ce2a0741a9c60283d7dee712df7a877a5` |
| `ProgrammableComponentStampedV1(bytes32,address,uint8,bytes32)` | `launchId`, `component`, `kind` | `0x8147265e7396d6400cee8d049456a1f7438fdfbe2a7c81c976d51ba67e52ff4b` |

The non-indexed launch fields are `poolManager`, `poolId`, and `stampHash`. The non-indexed route fields are `expectedResultHash` and `permitDigest`. The non-indexed component field is `runtimeCodeHash`.

### Stamp record

`launchStamp(bytes32 launchId)` returns one `StampRecordV1` tuple in this order:

| Index | Field | Type |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `kind` | `uint8` |
| 1 | `launchWallet` | `address` |
| 2 | `token` | `address` |
| 3 | `hook` | `address` |
| 4 | `poolManager` | `address` |
| 5 | `poolId` | `bytes32` |
| 6 | `poolKeyHash` | `bytes32` |
| 7 | `componentSetHash` | `bytes32` |
| 8 | `routePayloadHash` | `bytes32` |
| 9 | `routeLauncher` | `address` |
| 10 | `routeLauncherRuntimeCodeHash` | `bytes32` |
| 11 | `expectedResultHash` | `bytes32` |
| 12 | `permitDigest` | `bytes32` |
| 13 | `stampHash` | `bytes32` |

For an address-based lookup, `stampProof(address)` must return the same nonzero `launchId` and the record's `stampHash`.

## Consumer outcomes

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unavailable` | Router is not live for the requested block, the chain is inactive, or required manifest activation data is incomplete |
| `not-stamped` | A valid canonical lookup returned `bytes32(0)` |
| `stamped` | A nonzero lookup and its record, proof, identity, and bindings are consistent |
| `indeterminate` | RPC, ABI, runtime, block, decoding, or cross-check evidence is incomplete or inconsistent |

Only a successful canonical zero lookup is `not-stamped`. A timeout, pruned block, malformed response, chain mismatch, or unavailable finalized block is `indeterminate`.

## Deterministic point lookup

Bind all reads in one result to one canonical block:

1. Fetch the official discovery document and manifest.
2. Require status `live`, or `retired` for a historical read within the published range.
3. Require the complete trust tuple, finalized canary evidence, deployment bindings, runtime hash, ABI hash, event descriptors, and getter descriptors.
4. Require `eth_chainId` to equal the manifest `chainId`.
5. Resolve a finalized block or a caller-supplied canonical block to a concrete block number and hash. For an explicit block-number read, require the manifest's `64` confirmations. Do not mix `latest` reads. Use EIP-1898 `{ blockHash, requireCanonical: true }` for every `eth_getCode` and `eth_call` when the provider supports it. Otherwise use the resolved number for every read, then fetch that height again and require the closing hash to equal the opening hash before returning `stamped` or `not-stamped`.
6. Enforce `startBlock` and, if retired, `endBlock`.
7. Read Router code at that block and require its EVM Keccak-256 to equal `runtimeCodeHash`.
8. Hash the fetched ABI bytes with SHA-256; validate every advertised selector, topic, and indexed layout against that ABI.
9. At the same canonical block, call `CHAIN_ID`, all six immutable binding getters, and `eth_getCode` for the permit authority, Graph Factory, and PoolManager. Require exact manifest address and runtime-hash matches.
10. Call `launchIdByToken(token)` or `launchIdByPool(poolManager,poolId)`. Use `launchIdByComponent(component)` only for an explicitly exclusive component.
11. If the result is zero, return `not-stamped`.
12. Read `launchStamp(launchId)` at the same canonical block. Require a recognized nonzero `kind`, the queried token or pool identity, the immutable PoolManager, and nonzero commitment fields.
13. For a token or component, require `stampProof(address)` to match both `launchId` and `stampHash`.
14. For `CustomGraph`, require the record's route launcher and runtime hash to match the immutable Graph Factory binding. For `Classic`, retain the permit-bound route launcher and runtime from the record; do not invent a Classic immutable.
15. Complete the closing block-hash check when number-bound reads were used. Classify only from `record.kind`.

Remote RPC URLs must use HTTPS. Plaintext HTTP is accepted only for loopback development endpoints.

## Onchain backfill and live follow

Use one gap-free sequence for Router events:

1. Resolve the manifest and verify the Router identity, runtime, ABI URL, ABI SHA-256, events, getters, bindings, and finality policy.
2. Backfill `eth_getLogs` from `startBlock` in bounded chunks. Filter by the exact manifest Router address and the complete manifest `topic0` set; respect `endBlock` if the Router is retired.
3. Persist block number and hash, transaction hash and index, and log index for every candidate. Use those coordinates as the idempotency key.
4. At the same canonical block, cross-check the relevant `launchIdByToken`, `launchIdByPool`, or exclusive `launchIdByComponent` result, then `launchStamp`; use `stampProof` for address-based token or component checks.
5. Advance a durable checkpoint only through the finalized boundary. Apply the manifest's `64` confirmations to an explicit block-number boundary, or use the canonical finalized block.
6. Replay an overlap window on every run. Deduplicate identical coordinates and apply corrections idempotently.
7. If a stored block hash no longer matches, orphan affected observations, rewind to the last common finalized checkpoint, and replay before advancing.
8. After backfill reaches the finalized boundary, begin polling or a subscription from the overlapping checkpoint. Reconcile subscription results through the same log and getter checks so the backfill-to-live handoff has no gap.

A log with the correct topic from any other emitter is not Programmable provenance. A subscription is transport, not evidence; never advance the durable finalized checkpoint from an unverified notification alone.

## Atomic write path

Router V1 exposes exactly one payable market-bearing entry point:

```text
launchAndStampV1(
  (uint256,address,address,uint8,bytes32,bytes32,bytes32,bytes32,uint64,uint64,uint256),
  (bytes32,address,bytes32,(address,address,uint24,int24,address),bytes32,(uint8,address,bytes32,uint8,uint8)[]),
  bytes,
  bytes
) -> bytes32 stampHash

selector: 0xe5f6b8cd
```

The route execution and stamp write are atomic. `CustomGraph` uses the immutable Graph Factory. `Classic` uses the exact permit- and record-bound Classic route. The permit authority must be a nonzero EIP-1271 contract; there is no EOA authority fallback.

EIP-712 domain:

```text
name: ProgrammableLaunchStampRouter
version: 1
primaryType: ProgrammableLaunchPermitV1
```

Exact permit type:

```text
ProgrammableLaunchPermitV1(uint256 chainId,address router,address launchWallet,uint8 kind,bytes32 routePayloadHash,bytes32 expectedResultHash,bytes32 stampRequestHash,bytes32 nonce,uint64 validAfter,uint64 deadline,uint256 value)
```

Type hash:

```

Direct calls to a Classic launcher or Graph Factory outside the Router do not write canonical provenance. Single Factory is outside Router V1.

## Revert interface

The full ABI is normative. Router V1 publishes these custom errors:

```text
ComponentAlreadyStamped(address,bytes32)
DuplicateOrUnsortedComponent(address,address)
FactoryResultMismatch(uint8,uint256)
InvalidArrayLength(uint8,uint256,uint256)
InvalidBinding(uint8)
InvalidComponent(address,bytes32,bytes32)
InvalidPermitSignature()
InvalidShortString()
LaunchAlreadyStamped(bytes32)
NonCanonicalRoutePayload()
NonceAlreadyUsed(address,bytes32)
PermitAlreadyUsed(bytes32)
PermitOutsideValidityWindow(uint256,uint256,uint256)
PoolAlreadyInitialized(address,bytes32)
PoolAlreadyStamped(address,bytes32,bytes32)
ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall()
ResidualLaunchValue(uint256,uint256)
StringTooLong(string)
UnauthorizedLaunchWallet(address,address)
UnsupportedLaunchKind(uint8)
```

Consumers that decode errors must derive selectors from the pinned ABI and preserve unknown errors.

## Runtime-code limitations

Component and route runtime-code hashes record code observed when the stamp was written. A point-in-time match can detect shell-code drift, but for a proxy or beacon it does not establish the current implementation, beacon, admin, initialization state, or upgrade authority. Resolve those separately without changing the historical Router-origin result.

## Unsupported in Router V1

Do not assign a Router V1 label to:

- a launch before `startBlock` or a historical launch not executed through Router V1;
- Single Factory or direct Classic-launcher/Graph-Factory launches;
- a Classic launch inferred from the shared Classic hook;
- a post-hoc self-attestation;
- a copied Router, event, ABI, website, signature, or metadata field;
- a pool identified by `PoolId` without its PoolManager; or
- an unavailable, zero, malformed, or inconsistent lookup.

These are provenance rules. Terminals retain their own security, market-support, simulation, routing, and transaction policies.
